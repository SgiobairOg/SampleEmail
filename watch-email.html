Hi, I'm Jason Wilson. I started coding for the web in 1999/2000 and my first brush with HTML email was in 2005 when I created email templates for HarmonHomes.com. Not a lot has changed (for the better) in the email world so this is still an exercise in partial support and a fight to be responsive and cross platform.

One day, you know, we'll have CSS Grid support for Email Clients... then it gets fancy. 'Til then, want to know more about what I get up to if I'm not commuting, working, or parenting?
